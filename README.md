# Operation-Analytics-and-Investigating-Metric-spike

Our project is aimed at analyzing two cases â€“
 
1)Operation analysis of job data: we will try to find throughput, percentage share of language and display duplicate rows

2)Calculating metrics related to a social networking service: we will try to find user engagement, user growth, weekly retention, weekly engagement and email engagement as on September 2, 2014  

## Insights

User Engagement: we see a massive spike and a sudden dip during end of July and start of august, there might be a advertisement event causing this.

User growth: Growth rate continues to be high during the week, low on weekends.

Weekly retention: This chart shows a decrease in engagement among users who have signed up more than 10 weeks.

Weekly engagement by device: There is very big drop in phone engagement rates compared to computer and tablet, so there might be an issue with the mobile app of the service that is hindering long term user retention.

Email engagement: Email_opens are on a rise but email_clickthroughs are having a significant drop during late July and early august, so there might be a problem with the content present in the email, company should focus on email content marketing.
